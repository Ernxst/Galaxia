To get started with development, you will need a browser that runs JavaScript and some extra prerequisites:

- [Node.js (14)](https://nodejs.org) - _Package manager_
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) - _This should come with your Node installation._
- A (relatively recent) browser that allows JavaScript.

```bash
npm install
```

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

To serve the application in development mode, in a development server:

```

To launch application in production mode with necessary optimisations:
